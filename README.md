# Arduino Longboard

I built this longboard, with the help of some friends, to traverse the hills in my college town.


## Components

The code is split into a few components. The main library is [arduino-longboard](https://github.com/Coderlane/arduino-longboard), the code that ties everything together. That utilizes [arduino-bluetooth](https://github.com/Coderlane/arduino-bluetooth) which works with a [RN42](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN42) bluetooth module. Then there is the [host](https://github.com/Coderlane/arduino-bluetooth-longboard-host) which runs on the longboard and the [controller](https://github.com/Coderlane/arduino-bluetooth-longboard-controller) which is held in your hand.

### Longboard

The mounting of the electronics could use improvement. Here is what version 1 of the longboard looked like.
